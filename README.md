**Overview**
------------------------------
bookClub was a final project for our modern web programming class at UNC Chapel Hill. The goal of the site is to create a social platform and voting suite for members of a book club. Users can view the current book being read, favorite books, view other user's favorite books, and suggest and vote on new books to read. 

The app itself has a fully functioning frontend, backend, and database. The frontend uses the standard HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. We used expressJS to create a RESTful API that interacts with our SQL Database. The app is currently being run on Heroku for demonstration purposes. Links to the Heroku app and a PowerPoint presentation on bookClub are below.
